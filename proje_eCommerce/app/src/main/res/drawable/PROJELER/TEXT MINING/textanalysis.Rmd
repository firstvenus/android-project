This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}

```

```{r}
install.packages('plyr')
library(plyr)

install.packages('stringr')
library(stringr)

#my data
datafile <- file.choose()
data <- read.csv(datafile)


#reading data for positive and negative words
positivefile <- file.choose()
positive_words <- read.delim("positive-words.txt")

negativefile <- file.choose()
negative_words <- read.delim("negative-words.txt")

#getting words
positive_words <- scan("positive-words.txt", what = 'character')
negative_words <- scan("negative-words.txt", what = 'character')

negative_words <- c(negative_words, 'wtf', 'shitty', 'sucks')

#sentiment analysis

sentimentScore <- function(tweets, positive_words, negative_words, .progress='none')

  require(plyr)
  require(stringr)
  
  scores = laply(sentences, function(tweets, positive_words, negative_words) {
    
    # cleaning
    tweets = gsub('[[:punct:]]', '', tweets)
    tweets = gsub('[[:cntrl:]]', '', tweets)
    tweets = gsub('\\d+', '', tweets)
    # and convert to lower case:
    tweets = tolower(tweets)
    
    # split into words. str_split is in the stringr package
    word.list = str_split(tweets, '\\s+')
    # sometimes a list() is one level of hierarchy too much
    words = unlist(word.list)
    
    # compare our words to the dictionaries of positive & negative terms
    positive.matches = match(words, positive_words)
    negative.matches = match(words, negative_words)
    
    # match() returns the position of the matched term or NA
    # we just want a TRUE/FALSE:
    positive.matches = !is.na(positive.matches)
    negative.matches = !is.na(negative.matches)
    
    # and conveniently enough, TRUE/FALSE will be treated as 1/0 by sum():
    score = sum(positive.matches) - sum(negative.matches)
    
    return(score)
  }, positive_words, negative_words, .progress=.progress )
  
  scores.df = data.frame(score=scores, text=sentences)
  return(scores.df)

result <- sentimentScore(data$text,positive_words,negative_words)

summary(result$score)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
